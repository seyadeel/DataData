#### Installation

This code in written in Python 3.9.1 using Anaconda (3.0) for windows, Mac OS and Linux by installing spyder (4.2.1), JupyterLab (2.2.6), JupyterNotebook (6.2.0) and all the necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, matlibplot and geopandas , into its environment.  For command-line installation of Python, just execute the following command in preferred terminal.

- pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need to download country_vaccinations.csv from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress "here"). The same file is found in this directory [here](https://github.com/seyadeel/DataData "here") under the name covid_19_vaccination.csv.

#### Project Motivation

This is an Udacity Data Science Nano Degree project which focuses on the COVID-19 vaccination and vaccines. The main question covered in this project are 

	1 — What is the total number of vaccination in the world and which countries are leading in the process? 
	2 — What is the number of total vaccination per one hundred people and which countries are doing well? 
	3 — Which vaccine or vaccines are administered the most? 
	4 — Which country has the highest usage of a vaccine per hundred people?

#### File Description

**Datascience.Ipynb** – JupyterNotebook edited file

**DataScience.py** – Spyder edited and executed file

**covid_19_vaccination.csv** – The main dataset used for the project


#### Results

The results of the code and dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/seyadeel/DataData "here") (GitHub) and the blogpost for this project [here](https://tsegu-kahsay.medium.com/) (medium)
